# Abstract Screening Instructions (Rayyan)

This document outlines standardized procedures for screening abstracts using **Rayyan** as part of the systematic review titled:

**"Uncommon Sites of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Metastasis: A Systematic Review of Salivary Gland Involvement."**

## üîç Review Platform

All abstract screening will be performed using [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/), a free, web-based tool that supports blinded and collaborative screening for systematic reviews.

## ‚úÖ Abstract Inclusion Criteria

Reviewers should mark **"Include"** for abstracts that meet **all** of the following:

- Involve patients with **confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**.
- Report **metastasis to the parotid or other salivary glands**.
- Contain **diagnostic confirmation** of the metastatic site (e.g., imaging, pathology, or biopsy).
- Are case reports, case series, observational studies, or clinical studies **documenting HCC metastasis to salivary or rare anatomical head/neck sites**.
- Include systematic reviews or meta-analyses with relevant HCC-parotid data.
- Are published in **any language**, with **no date restrictions**.
- Provide **clinical details** about diagnosis, presentation, treatment, or outcomes of parotid/salivary gland metastasis from HCC.

## ‚ùå Abstract Exclusion Criteria

Reviewers should mark **"Exclude"** if the abstract:

- Does not involve **HCC** as the confirmed primary tumor.
- Focuses **only** on common metastatic sites (e.g., lung, bone, lymph nodes) without specific mention of **parotid or salivary glands**.
- Is an editorial, commentary, narrative review, or **conference abstract lacking extractable data**.
- Describes **experimental, animal, or in vitro** research without human subjects.
- Fails to provide enough information to confirm metastatic HCC involvement of the parotid/salivary glands.

## üß≠ Screening Instructions in Rayyan

1. **Login** to Rayyan and open the shared project folder.
2. Review each abstract **independently** and apply one of the following labels:
   - ‚úÖ **Include**
   - ‚ùå **Exclude**
   - ‚ùì **Maybe/Unclear**
3. Use the **Comments** field to:
   - Justify exclusions or ambiguous decisions.
   - Flag duplicates or any article you suspect has already been included elsewhere.
4. Do **not unblind** decisions until both reviewers have completed their screening.
5. Articles labeled **"Maybe"** or with discordant votes will proceed to **consensus review**.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

- When in doubt, err on the side of **inclusion** ‚Äî borderline abstracts can be reassessed during full-text review.
- Consistency is key ‚Äî use the criteria above to minimize reviewer variation.

üìÅ _All abstracts included from this step will proceed to the `full_text_review/` stage._
