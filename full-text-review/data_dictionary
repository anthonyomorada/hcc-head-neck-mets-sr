# Data Extraction Protocol for Systematic Review: HCC Metastasis to Head and Neck

This document outlines the standardized procedure for data extraction in our systematic review of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with metastasis to the head and neck region. All data should be extracted from eligible full-text articles that meet inclusion criteria after title/abstract screening and full-text review.

## üîç Data Extraction Overview

Each row in the data spreadsheet corresponds to a **unique patient case** extracted from a published study. If a study includes multiple cases, each case should be represented in a separate row.

### Extract the following variables for each case:

| Column Name               | Description                                                                                  | Data Type        | Example                       |

## ‚úÖ Data Entry Instructions

- **Be consistent with terminology** (e.g., use "Male"/"Female", not "M"/"F").
- Use **"NA"** for fields that are **not available** in the paper.
- Round numerical values **to the nearest whole number** unless decimal precision is relevant (e.g., AFP levels).
- Use the **original terminology from the paper** wherever possible and clarify in the Notes if needed.

## üì¶ Saving the Data

- Use the standardized CSV template: `hcc-mets-hn-sr.csv`
- Save your work frequently.
- Back up your file on GitHub under the `/data/` folder.
